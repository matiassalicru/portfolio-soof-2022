    "text": "Hi! 👋🏻 My name is Sofia Dolcemáscolo and I’m from Córdoba Argentina. I’m a UX / UI designer. In my free time I like to listen to music and play Valorant ( Sometimes I do streams on Twitch ) I consider myself as a curious person that always want to keep learning (currently I’m reinforcing my knowledge on platzi) I like to watch YouTube videos related to UX/UI, and I have a kitty 🐈 named Sam that loves to be in camera behind me!"
